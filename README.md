## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was one of the easier projects and I did not encounter too many issues as this only required basic HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

I want to get better at using and understanding media queries, and which sizes are appropriate for each viewport.
